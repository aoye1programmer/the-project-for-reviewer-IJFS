This simulation model was created in Matlab2016a version, and you need to download the Truetime 2.0 toolbox before running it. The download path for the Truetime 2.0 toolbox is as follows: https://www.control.lth.se/research/tools-and-software/truetime/ The operation steps are as follows:

1. Enter fuzzy delayM2optimal.fis in the MATLAB command line window

2. Export fuzzy functions to the workspace

3. Open FDCDC_ PSS_ 30ms delay_ Github.slx and FDCDC_ PSS_ 40msdelay_ Github.slx file and run it.

4. Open the scope (Pe3, wm3, Peo3 and suncontroller output) to obtain Figure 17-21 in the paper.
